All methods, except the execution of a public query require authentication in the form of a Project token, passed as a query parameter named \"token\".  A Project token for each project owned by an account is obtained when logging in. For 28.io projects the login endpoint is \"/api/auth\" and is documented in the 28.io REST API. For xbrl.io projects the login endpoint is \"/auth\" and is documented in the xbrl.io REST API. Both endpoints are OAuth2 compliant. Alternatively, a project can define its own login process.",
